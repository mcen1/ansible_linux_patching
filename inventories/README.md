# inventories
This playbok has the ability to use both dynamic and static inventories, depending on your use case. When using dynamic inventories, you can specify hostvars like ssh ports or a specific set of packages to exclude from update by putting them in the accompanying .dict file.

- dynamic_inventory_from_env.py: Gets list of servers from environment variable ANSSERVERS and puts it into a format Ansible understands.
- dynamic_inventory_meta.dict: Accompanies the dynamic inventory script and allows customization through hostvars for an otherwise generic inventory and playbook defaults
- example.ini: An example static inventory file, used for when very specific playbooks must be used for patching. A good example of this is a rancher playbook. The host targets would be set in this example.ini file. Traditional Ansible grouping of inventory targets is supported as well as any additional group_vars that may be needed.
- group_vars and group_vars/all: Standard Ansible documentation will cover this. The variables set in all will apply to both static inventory files as well as anything generated by the dynamic inventory script.
